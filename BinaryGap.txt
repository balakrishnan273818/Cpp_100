The Broken are the more Evolved

1) While loops should always have an increment operator inside it or else we'll
stuck inside a never ending loop.
2) variable used for certain temporary operation within a loop should always be reinitializaed 
before its next use
3) no body can write a perfect fuction on one go
4) understanding even the most complex of the test cases is half job done
5) if u use modulo operator the result will be either 0 or 1 depending upon the input
6) if u use division operator the result is the quotient
